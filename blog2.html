        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Do you know what the chances are of us existing
            in this world? 1 in 400 trillion, or even less. Yes that’s right! Oh how grateful should we be! Yet, we take
            most things in our lives for granted. Heck, we take life itself for granted! We allow ourselves to be
            constantly bombarded by things that are random, and irrelevant to our lives. We then care enough about these
            things to submit our emotions to them, letting them dictate our mental state.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Understand that there are only two reasons to try
            to do anything in life: a) because it feels good, or b) because it’s something you think to be good or
            right. Sometimes these two reasons align. Something feels good AND is that the right thing to try to to and
            that is just fantastic. But more often, these two things don’t align. Something feels absolutely torturous
            but is right/good (getting up at 5AM and working out), or something feels amazing but is the bad/wrong thing
            to do (fill in your own).</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Acting based on our feelings is easy. It’s like
            scratching an itch. There’s a sense of relief that comes along with it. It’s a quick satisfaction. But then
            that satisfaction is gone just as quickly as it came. Acting based on what’s good/right is difficult. For
            one, knowing what’s good/right isn’t always straightforward. We probably need to sit down and think hard
            about it, often having to fight through our lower impulses.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">But where do we find the balance? For this we
            must come back to the simple truth which is that feelings don’t necessarily mean anything. They merely mean
            whatever you allow them to mean. The point is that you get to decide. And many of us have either forgotten
            or never realised that fact. And that’s what emotional minimalism is: understanding your emotions and
            decoupling them from reality.</p>
