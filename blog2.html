        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">
            Do you know what the chances are of us existing
            in this world? 1 in 400 trillion, or even less. Yes that’s right! Oh how grateful should we be! Yet, we take
            most things in our lives for granted. Heck, we take life itself for granted. We allow ourselves to be
            constantly bombarded by things that are random, and irrelevant to our lives. We then care enough about these
            things to submit our emotions to them, letting them dictate our mental state.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">With all the talk lately about mental health and
            wellbeing, I felt like giving my two cents on it. The title of this blog is exactly what you should
            practise, and I try to outline it ahead. I would suggest you try and gradually embed it in your mindset.</p>
        <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Introduction_2"></a>How to?</h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">We often act based on our feelings, and rarely
            based on rational thought. Acting based on our feelings can be compared to scratching an itch. We do feel
            relief, it’s a quick satisfaction. But then
            the satisfaction is gone just as quickly as it came. Acting based on what’s good/right is hard. It requires
            a fair bit of thought, i.e. mental workout, and we often have to fight back our lower impulses. However, the end result,
            especially in the long term, is tremendously beneficial to our mental health. I'd also like to point out here that prioritising what we care about can alleviate our discomfort with the whole process above. Basically, don't stress/care about the things that you can't truly control.</p>
        <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Introduction_2"></a>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Now, coming back to the simple truth: feelings don’t necessarily mean anything. They merely mean
            what you allow them to mean. You are the decider. That's why as a species, humans are distinct from any other living beings. We have a conscience, and THAT is how we should decide things. Rational thought. Many of us have either forgotten
            or never realised that fact. Now if I had to wrap this whole thing up in a sentence, this seems perfect: Emotional minimalism  is understanding your emotions and detaching them from reality.</p>
            <p>P.S. In hindsight, the closing sentence would've been a great title, but maybe a bit too long. :)</p>
