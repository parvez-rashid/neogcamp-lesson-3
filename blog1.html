        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Do you ever feel like this: <em>“I know what’s
                wrong with me, and I know what to do about it. Why am I still not able to take action? Wait, what’s
                actually wrong with me?”</em>. Thus, the thought comes full-circle. As I write this blog, this very
            thought runs through my mind, and I curse myself for not being able to take meaningful actions towards my
            goals. But I try to look at the bright side. The very emergence of this thought indicates that I’m somewhat
            self-aware. If you’re in a similar position, then you have a head start in your self-improvement journey.
            Let’s understand it better.</p>
        <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=6 data-line-end=7><a id="The_Problem_6"></a>The Problem</h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">The two main reasons why we aren’t able take
            action are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><em>Lack of purpose</em></li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13"><em>Lack of discipline / Lack of
                    motivation</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Having a “why” is fundamental. If we don’t have
            a purpose for taking action, we can’t even start. Sure, discipline is key, but that can only come if we have
            a true sense of purpose. Discipline comes next. For some, it might be interchangeable with motivation, which
            is the case for me, <em>i.e.</em>, I feel discipline creates motivation. But for others, the reverse might
            be true. Either way, we have to pivot one around the other.</p>
        <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=15 data-line-end=16><a id="The_Solution_15"></a>The Solution</h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Now that we have a clearer idea about the
            problem, let’s move on to the solution, which is actually simple. Keep in mind that self-improvement is not
            a goal, it’s a journey, a continuous process. This is where many people falter. We have to learn to enjoy
            the process more than craving the satisfaction of reaching a goal. This is the only way in which we can
            ensure that we’re a better version of ourselves today than we were yesterday.</p>
